##Support services (new)  
While developing genealogy, we received many inquiries from devs and teams asking us about paid support. Some of these requests lead to fruitful collaborations, so we finally decided to launch such a paid support option.
If you need premium support when building your own applications with genealogy, we can help. Our support packages start at Â£500 per month, and include up to 8 hours of direct contact and support each month at no extra charge.
With premium support you will get:

First priority on having your issues addressed
A private repo within our GitLab instance where you can host your project
Help understanding the environment
Help becoming more proficient when developing your projects
Advice and mentoring
Detailed code reviews
Support and Guidance on Laraval and Vue generally. 
1-2-1 assistance on version upgrades
Direct communication via Slack (during our office hours only)
We have 4 members on our dedicated support team, so there should be little if any waiting!
